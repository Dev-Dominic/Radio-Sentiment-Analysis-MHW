Under his tenure, Sagicor grew from a mutual company with less than $100 million of assets to a publicly listed multi-national corporation with over $10 billion of assets. Sagicor has greatly benefitted from Dodridge’s visionary leadership to become the leading financial services provider in the Caribbean with an exciting growth platform in North America.”

Khimji further stated, “The board of directors unanimously supported the succession of Andre to the role of President and CEO. Andre has worked hand in hand with Dodridge in developing and executing Sagicor’s strategy since he joined the Company in 2019. We believe Andre is the right individual to drive forward with the next stage of Sagicor’s growth.”

As I step away from my current role, I am delighted to pass the baton to Andre Mousseau. Andre has worked very closely with me over the last four years and has been instrumental in the execution of many of our strategic initiatives during this time. I am confident that Andre is the right person to lead Sagicor through the next phase of its development.”

Mousseau said “I am honoured to be appointed to lead this great organization. I look forward to continuing to work with Sagicor’s talented team as we execute on our growth initiatives, with a clear focus on delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders.”

Mousseau joined Sagicor as Group Chief Financial Officer in 2019, leading Sagicor’s finance function, capital raising efforts and overseeing its investment and acquisition strategy. He was subsequently promoted to Group Chief Operating Officer, in addition to his oversight of Sagicor’s financial operations, in 2021.

The police had indicated in October that more than $50 million was involved.

Sagicor Group parted ways with Moulton White in recent weeks, informing that her position would “no longer form part of the structure”, effective December 31.

Moulton White’s attorney Bert Samuels is maintaining that his client is ""totally innocent"" and is threatening legal action against ""all those who are concerned in trumping up these charges"" against Moulton White."

This follows the completion of the purchase of 100 per cent of the shares in Alliance Financial Services Limited (AFSL) in April 2022.

The purchase consideration includes an initial cash consideration of $2.6 billion and contingent cash consideration of up to $3.4 billion, based on specified performance criteria, it was disclosed in Sagicor's financial report for the second quarter ended June 2022.

Total goodwill and purchased intangibles arising from the Alliance acquisition was $3.49 billion. 

Commenting on the purchase of the securities dealer book of business of Alliance Investment, Sagicor CEO Christopher Zacca said: “This client portfolio purchase expands the business of Sagicor investments, offering an opportunity to serve a wider client base.""

Zacca added that Sagicor is delighted to ""welcome our clients to the Sagicor family and look forward to giving them stellar service, personalised attention, sound financial advice and diversified investment products and services to meet their investment goals.”  

Meanwhile, Sagicor said Alliance Financial is showing encouraging revenue growth in its remittance and cambio segments.

Sagicor Group, in its recent financial report, noted that the Alliance Financial acquisition represents a move into a new business segment and affords the group an opportunity to expand its product offerings to its customers. 

The company reported stable results for the six-month period, producing net profit attributable to stockholders of $6.04 billion, a 25 per cent increase over the prior year.

The individual life insurance segment continued its exceptional performance and was supported by growth
in the employee benefits and commercial banking segments.

Sagicor Group’s results were generated from total revenues of $46.88 billion, which included year-over-year growth in revenues from core operations, being net premium income, net investment income and
fee income. 

Arising from the AFSL acquisition, new business for Sagicor includes cambio, remittance, and microfinance. 

AFSL, which is now fully enabled on the international MoneyGram platform, recently entered into an agreement with Unicomer Jamaica.

The partnership allows MoneyGram customers to pick up their money transfers at Courts stores island-wide and will see Alliance's agent network expand by almost 50 per cent.

“We are excited about this new development because it means our clients can conveniently collect their money at additional locations,” said Omar Brown, CEO of Alliance Financial Services.

“Partnering with Unicomer means that in addition to our over 52 sub-agents and five Alliance offices, these 28 Courts stores island-wide will greatly expand our network,” Brown said."

Sagicor Group Jamaica President and CEO Christopher Zacca said the company's individual life insurance segment performed well while the employee benefits segment showed a strong recovery. 

It has nonetheless noted that global and domestic challenges continue to weigh heavily on the economic outlook for 2022.

“Growth prospects have been limited by the continued threat of COVID-19 variants and the geopolitical tension between Ukraine and Russia, which have resulted in rising energy prices, supply chain disruptions and elevated inflation,” stated Sagicor. 

The company said it continues to monitor all of these macro variables in its management of the company and remains conservative in its outlook.

Total revenue was $23.8 billion in the March 2022 quarter compared to $23.1 billion a year ago.

A $1 billion jump in tourism revenue to $1.7 billion in the quarter aided in higher sales.

GraceKennedy,12/02/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/gracekennedy-goes-solarr,GraceKennedy goes solar,"The new Hi-Lo Food Stores (Hi-Lo) location in Negril, Westmoreland, and the Grace Agro-Processors (GAP) Plant in Denbigh, Clarendon are the latest facilities in the GraceKennedy (GK) Group to ‘go solar’.

Both locations have installed solar power grid-tied systems with a combined generating capacity of 925 kWh per day, which are projected to meet approximately 50 – 60 per cent of the energy needs at the new Hi-Lo location and up to 50 per cent of the energy needs at GAP Denbigh.

Solar grid-tied systems use solar panels and inverters for power generation. They do not require batteries to store power for night-time use and are connected to the electrical power grid.

“The pivot towards solar energy is embedded in our new GK energy policy, which was launched in May this year and aims to diversify the Group’s energy supply, through sustainable energy solutions, including renewables,” said Frank James, CEO of GK Foods – Domestic.

Full implementation of the policy is projected to recover approximately US$1 million in energy cost reductions annually for GK by 2026.

“This move also aligns with GK’s ESG (environmental, social and governance) agenda, which was launched earlier this year, and among other things, charges us with being responsible stewards of our environment,” James added.

For Cathrine Kennedy, General Manager of Hi-Lo Food Stores, the new Negril store, which opened on October 15, represents the Hi-Lo of the future.

“To ensure that we are sustainable in our ongoing development, we made a strategic decision that every new build Hi-Lo store going forward will incorporate solar energy, Kennedy said.

Carl Barnett, Senior General Managerof Manufacturing at Grace Foods, who is also leading the implementation of GK’s new energy policy across the Group, commented, “GAP started operations in 2019 and since then we have seen a gradual increase in our electricity usage. We determined that the grid-tie system would be the most suitable for our needs, as approximately 68 per cent of the plant’s power usage occurs in the day.”

The solar installation at GAP Denbigh was brought online on November 1 and is expected to generate payback in under four years.

Hi-Lo Negril and GAP Denbigh, join several other GK subsidiaries including Dairy Industries Jamaica Limited and NALCAN (formerly Grace Food Processors (GFP) Canning) in Kingston, GK’s Distribution Centre in Spanish Town, and GFP Meats in Savanna-la-mar, Westmoreland, in implementing on-site solar power generation.

GFP Meats also recently commenced an energy project expansion, where liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be added to its current energy mix.

GraceKennedy’s new Headquarters in Downtown Kingston, which opened in 2019, is also solar-powered, with that system currently providing 30 per cent of the building’s daily energy needs. 

Since the start of 2022, GraceKennedy has invested over US$3 million in energy efficiency projects.

GK’s new energy policy supports green building practices, which incorporate energy-saving approaches in the design and construction phases. Energy efficiency assessments are now required for all GK capital expenditure projects going forward. The policy also calls for equipment upgrades, and the installation of energy management systems across GK’s businesses, to closely monitor energy consumption.

James continued, “Heavy dependence on imported petroleum products contributes to GK’s susceptibility to the volatilities of the world’s oil market including supply and price fluctuations.”

“With the introduction of our new energy policy, we are demonstrating our commitment to the development of a sustainable energy strategy with a focus on exploiting indigenous renewable sources, all while reducing the Group’s carbon footprint,” he concluded."
GraceKennedy,11/28/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/gracekennedy-surpasses-100b-revenue-target-set-mark-anniversaryy,GraceKennedy surpasses $100b revenue target set to mark anniversary,"The GraceKennedy Group has posted revenues of $107.4 billion, an increase of 12.2 per cent or $11.7 billion over the corresponding period in 2021, surpassing the $100 billion target the company previously set to mark its 100th anniversary. 


GraceKennedy CEO Don Wehby said the company is “significantly” above that target with three months to spare in its financial year.

GraceKennedy earned 55.3 per cent of its revenue from its Jamaican operations, with 26.6 per cent coming from its North American operations, 11.6 per cent from the UK and Europe and 6.6 per cent from its other Caribbean-based businesses.

Revenues from both the operations inside and external to Jamaica ""are growing quite well, however for the first nine months of 2022, Jamaica is growing at a faster rate than our overseas businesses,"" Wehby told a recent investor briefing. 

Operating profit across the business segments was mixed, with overall profit before other income of $5.3 billion, a $550 million or 9.4 per cent decline compared to the prior year. 

Profit before tax stood at $7.7 billion, 9.4 per cent or $803 million lower than the corresponding 2021 with net profit after tax closing the review period at $5.6 billion, a $586 million or 9.4 per cent decline.

“Our profits from outside of Jamaica has actually increased as a percentage of the pie from 45 to 47 per cent, and inside Jamaica has gone down slightly but both are showing good performances,” Wehby said. 

Net profit attributable to stockholders also declined, closing the nine months at $5.2 billion, $458 million or 8.1 per cent or lower than the similar period of 2021. 

Earnings per stock unit for the period was $5.27. 

Noting the “significant headwinds” of the financial times, Wehby said the company expects the rising global inflation to continue impacting the GKG’s operations but that the company is focused on finishing the year on a high. 

Speaking to the impact of global inflation on its business lines, the GK boss said the company’s remittance business had felt the passthrough impact of the 8.2 per cent inflation rate in the US, the UK's 10.1 per cent and Canada’s at 6.9 per cent on the disposable income of diaspora members in those regions.

“One would think the rising inflation would more affect our food business, but I can tell you the more significant impact of the global inflation has been on our remittance business,” Wehby said noting the two per cent year-over-year or US$50 million decline in remittances to Jamaica.  

GraceKennedy Money Services Limited (GKMS) reported a decline in revenues and profit before tax, “primarily attributed to lower transaction volumes and reduced foreign exchange gains,"" the company noted in its financial statement of the reporting period.

Speaking on the performance of its Hi-Lo location that opened in Negril in October, Wehby said the location is ""significantly better” than anticipated.

“With the upcoming tourist season, we expect it to break all records that we have out in place,” he said noting, GKG continues to look at opportunities to expand its retail network.  

Its Majesty Joint Venture in Florida also now sees the company’s patties being sold in Trader Joe’s, one of the largest retail chains in the United States. 

Grace Foods (USA), Inc acquire a 49 per cent equity stake in Majesty Foods LLC Majesty Food in 2018. Majesty Foods is a Florida-based manufacturer of patty and empanada products. 

“In fact, an announcement will be made shortly. We have expanded to one of the largest supermarket chains in south Florida where we are going to be producing their patties exclusively under their brand,” Wehby said. 

He continued: “There is significant growth left in the patties and empanada business in the USA.”  

GKG’s food business recorded overall growth in revenues compared to the corresponding period of 2021. "
GraceKennedy,11/11/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/gracekennedy-profit-down-one-quarterr,GraceKennedy profit down by one-quarter,"The profit at GraceKennedy Limited (GK) declined by 25 per cent to $1.7 billion in its September 2022 quarter, even though revenue ticked higher. 

CEO Don Wehby said that the group continues to operate in an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment characterised by rising inflation globally, an inconsistent supply chain, increasing interest rates and distribution costs.

“In addition, ongoing global geopolitical tensions and conflicts continue to impact food prices and our supply channels. These challenges have led to margins being compressed,” said Wehby. 

He cited high global inflation, the disposable income of remittance customers in the sending markets as factors that impacted its remittance business.

The group focused on its nine-month results, which are down at a lesser amount or 8.1 per cent totalling $5.2 billion. 

Wehby said the group recorded “strong top-line growth”, realising revenues of $107.4 billion, an increase of 12.2 per cent or $11.7 billion a year earlier. 

Operating profit across the business segments was mixed, with overall profit before other income down 9.4 per cent decline compared to the prior year. 

Profit before tax (PBT) was also down 9.4 per cent. 

In response, GK said it has redoubled its cost containment efforts and implemented strategies to grow revenues and profits sustainably.
 
Notwithstanding the headwinds, GraceKennedy said it remains cautiously optimistic about the future and expects to end the year with a positive fourth quarter.

The GraceKennedy Financial Group also delivered a mixed performance. GK’s banking and investment segment performed well, while GraceKennedy Money Services reported a decline in revenues and gross profit, primarily due to current trends in Jamaica’s remittance market. 

GK’s Insurance segment showed robust revenue growth; however, profits declined marginally due to lower-than-projected returns on investment income and higher-than-anticipated claims costs related to inflation. 

“We have implemented initiatives to stimulate growth in remittances, which we are confident will produce a positive outcome. The advancement of our digital transformation agenda is critical in this regard, so I am happy to report that our GK ONE mobile app now offers customers the ability to receive remittances as well as pay bills,” Wehby said."
GraceKennedy,11/04/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/gracekennedy-partners-ding-dong-financial-education-seriess,GraceKennedy partners with Ding Dong for financial education series,"GraceKennedy Financial Group (GKFG) has launched its financial education series, dubbed Talk Sense, aimed at demystifying financial concepts for Jamaicans to boost financial literacy.

The hybrid launch of the GK Money Sense Masterclass was held on Tuesday in collaboration with local entertainer Kemar ‘Ding Dong’ Ottey and will focus on teaching the public about budgeting, saving, insurance, remittances, pensions, financial security, among others, over an 18-week period.

Packaged in short relatable episodes for social media, the programme aims to help the average citizen understand financial topics that are often technical and difficult to understand.

Speaking to the importance of breaking down traditional financial concepts into simple language in the design of the programme, Deputy CEO of GKFG, Steven Whittingham said one of the core elements of Talk Sense is to demystify financial products by removing the complexity of financial information to promote education and ease of access for customers.

For CEO of GKFG, Grace Burnett, Ding Dong’s “authentic” personality resonates with average Jamaica so he will be key in helping to transmit the information in easily understood ways to the average man.

GKFG took this approach, she said, since many Jamaicans are still intimidated by traditional banking and remain hesitant to use modern financial services.

“The project is designed as an adult financial empowerment programme where you can teach people how to manage their money and about what’s important in terms of how you provide for yourself and protect your family [financially],” Whittingham said.

Participants in the Master Class can also expect to benefit from the financial lessons Ding Dong learnt from his grandmother as well as those he has picked up since commencing his business relationship with the GKFG, key among them – paying yourself first when you work.

He said this means “…taking care of yourself. You have to do something nice for yourself…because you work hard.”

Another lesson he said he has learnt is to set goals and start small.

For example: “Sometimes it doesn’t make sense to aim for that big house. People feel like goals are ultimate, like the big house and if I can’t that I’m not going to buy a house…so sometimes you have to start small from a one or two-bedroom house and you don’t take a loan outside of your means,” he said.

“You have to get something in your head and learn how to manoeuvre money. It’s easy to make money sometimes but it’s harder to keep it. Since my affiliation with GK, I’ve learned so much about money and banking. I’ve learned it’s not where you’re from, it's just your mindset of where you want to be,” he said.

The masterclasses can be accessed through the GKFG’s YouTube and Facebook pages."

This year, GKF removed over 37,000 pounds of garbage at its annual clean-up series during held on September 10 and 17 respectively.

The first clean-up on September 10, saw over 200 GK staff and their families, GK scholars, members of Kingston Church of Christ, Tornadoes Swim Club and teachers, and students and parents of Hopefield Prep, turn out to clean up Gun Boat Beach on the Palisadoes strip in Kingston. 

Gail Moss-Solomon, General Counsel & Chief Corporate Secretary of GraceKennedy Limited, volunteered at the clean-up with her daughter, Sierra. Moss-Solomon explained that she attends the clean-up activity annually with her daughters.

“It’s important to do whatever we can to save mankind. GraceKennedy has been committed for many years to being kind to the environment and has solidified its commitment by ensuring that ESG is a key pillar in our 2030 vision,” she added. 

Oliver Tomlinson, Acting CEO of Canopy Insurance commented, “This is my first beach clean-up and it is an amazing experience, a huge eye opener. I had no idea there was so much waste on the coastline, we are damaging the environment and we cannot continue like this.”

“I really feel sad for all the animals living in the mangroves after seeing all those plastic bottles that have washed ashore,” commented Ria Maragh, a grade six student at Hopefield Prep. 

In two hours, the volunteers collected approximately 32,000 pounds of waste from the site, including 2,272 pounds of plastics and 29,374 pounds of other waste. "

Commenting on the 2021 results, GK Group CEO, Don Wehby stated “In the face of the pandemic our GK team remained stronger together, consistently going above and beyond to provide our customers with the highest standard of products and services, whilst working to achieve our strategic goals. These results are testament to the hard work of our team and the loyalty of our customers around the world, who continue to support our businesses year after year.”

“It’s a monumental milestone for our company and for Jamaicans around the world, who are very much a part of our GK story. Also, to consistently be delivering such a strong performance after a century in operation is truly an extraordinary accomplishment.”

GK’s Foods business performed extremely well in 2021, despite the challenges associated with high inflation and supply chain delays. Both GK Foods – Domestic and GK Foods – International recorded double-digit growth in revenue and profitability over the previous year, with GK Foods (USA) LLC notably reporting an improved performance over the exceptional returns it recorded in 2020.

A new e-commerce platform from GK’s Hi-Lo Food Stores supermarket chain, Hi-Lo Online, was also launched, and the development of GKFG’s much-anticipated GK ONE mobile app was completed.

“We will continue to execute GK’s strategy going forward, including our focus on M&A and digital transformation. Our new GK ONE app is slated for launch before the end of March, and we have several transactions in the pipeline as we advance our M&A strategy,” Wehby said.

Supply chain management, inventory management, and providing new delivery channels and innovative solutions also continue to be key areas of focus for our businesses.

“And of course, above all, we remain firmly committed to our we care mantra, by supporting the well-being of the communities we serve around the world and by making the health and safety of our team and other stakeholders our top priority,” the CEO added."
GraceKennedy,01/05/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/gracekennedy-implements-vaccine-mandate,GraceKennedy implements vaccine mandate,"The GraceKennedy Group has announced that it will implement a COVID-19 vaccination policy for employees and contractors this year.

GK joins at least two other major companies to implement a vaccine mandate.

Under the policy, as of January 14, GK team members will be required to disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status to the company.

The COVID-19 vaccination requirement will then take effect on February 11, when all GK employees, contractors and consultants will be required to be either fully or partially vaccinated against COVID-19.

Then, on April 29, 2022, all GK employees, contractors and consultants will be required to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or be subject to COVID-19 PCR testing every two weeks.

If team members, contractors or consultants opt not to be fully vaccinated by April 29 and choose to take a PCR test instead, the cost of the tests will be borne by them.

GK Group CEO Don Wehby said the timing of the policy has been carefully considered based on the availability of vaccines in the markets where GK operates, and the time required between the first and second dose of some types of vaccines.

Wehby said despite the company’s best efforts to sensitize staff via awareness sessions and vaccine blitzes, vaccination rates across the group vary considerably by location, and in some places, they remain too low.

“This is particularly worrying as the highly contagious Omicron variant of the virus spreads around the world. I consider the GK team a part of my extended family, and their safety is of paramount importance to me. So, in keeping with GK’s commitment and my own personal commitment to provide a safe working environment for our team, a COVID-19 vaccination policy is being rolled out across our Group,” Wehby told staff at a virtual town hall on Wednesday morning.

The vaccine policy will apply to all new and existing employees of GK and will also extend to the company’s third-party contractors, consultants, and independent contractors.

GK said applications for exemptions from the vaccination directive for medical reasons will be considered.

Details of the draft policy were presented to the GK team on Wednesday morning, and staff was given the opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback. Professor of Public Health, Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Dr Peter Figueroa also presented on the importance of COVID-19 vaccination and participated in the question-and-answer segment at the town hall.

“Many of us have lost colleagues, friends, family members, and other loved ones to this virus. It has been an extremely difficult time for us all, so we must do all that we can to stop the spread of this devastating disease. I believe that widespread vaccination will be vital in winning our fight against COVID-19, and I have made a personal commitment to the GK team that I will do everything in my power to ensure that every GK team member who wishes to get vaccinated has the opportunity to do so,” Wehby said."

Barita gave the assurance in a letter sent on Sunday to its clients which has been obtained by Loop News.

The assurance follows the fraud scandal which has rocked Stocks and Securities Limited (SSL), which has generated unease in sections of the financial sector in Jamaica.

Barita told its clients that it's writing to address recent media reports regarding alleged financial fraud in the industry. The entity noted that the news has understandably raised concerns among the public regarding the safety and security of their investments. 

This positions the company to be a safe haven for its clients

""At Barita, we pride ourselves on our strong financial foundation established over the course of 45 years, further strengthened since the acquisition by Cornerstone, as reflected in our formidable prudential ratios, including our capital adequacy ratio which is significantly above regulatory requirements and well above the industry average.

""This positions the company to be a safe haven for its clients as we have the capacity to fully absorb several shocks, whether emanating from risk factors associated with financial markets or our business operations, including occupational fraud,"" the company wrote. 

Barita told its clients that with shareholders’ equity of over J$32 billion as at September 30, 2022, it has by far the largest capital base in the securities dealing industry. 

The entity noted that this makes it the third largest financial institution among commercial banks and securities dealers in the country by shareholders’ equity, a step that was deliberately taken over the last 4 years by Cornerstone. "
Barita,09/06/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/barita-concludes-massive-land-purchase-st-ann,Barita concludes massive land purchase in St Ann,"Barita Investments Limited has inked a deal with an entity owned by businessman Karl Hendrickson, which has resulted in Barita being the new owner of 101.4 acres of land in St Ann which is part of Windsor Estate.

The land has a major beachfront and is situated in the vicinity of the Marina Bay development.

The land was purchased from National Continental Corporation Limited for approximately US $60M, which is over J$9 billion.

Paul Simpson — founder of the Cornerstone Group that owns Barita — was reportedly integral to inking the deal.

The 39-year-old Simpson, who has fast developed a reputation in local and regional corporate circles as an investment banker and funder raiser extraordinaire, is also the Deputy Chairman of Barita.

Simpson and senior executives at Barita were mum this week when contacted about the entity's latest land acquisition. However, reports indicate that the land bought from National Continental Corporation Limited will be used for the development of high-end villas, resort homes and luxury residential complexes.

Last year, Barita bought the 250-acre Reggae Beach property in St Mary from business mogul Michael Lee-Chin.

In recent months, Barita also purchased the three-acre Ruins property in St Ann.

The Reggae Beach property is expected to see major developments in the coming months as Barita has entered into a public/private sector arrangement for the construction and rollout of a multipurpose essential services development project."

Barita,05/20/2022,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/barita-receives-psojs-rating-corporate-governancee,Barita receives PSOJ’s A-rating for corporate governance,"Barita Investments Limited has been rated as one of the top-performing companies on the Jamaica Stock Exchange (JSE), following the Private Sector Organisation’s (PSOJ) performance review of companies listed on the Junior and Main Markets that conform to corporate governance best practices as outlined by the Corporate Governance Index (CGI). 

Company Chairman, Mark Myers, explained that the review conducted by the JSE through an independent body, the Corporate Governance Index Review Committee, further cements Barita’s reliability, efficiency and transparency as one of the island’s leading brokerage firms.

“This is a result of the last three years of resolute and collaborative work at the board level, which has been cascaded down to the management and staff at the company. It reflects our deep, uncompromising commitment to the highest standards of governance which involves the progressive establishment of robust structures, policies, procedures, and disclosure requirements. These are bedrock principles to ensuring the protection of our customers while sustainably delivering superior results over the long term to all stakeholders including our staff, shareholders and regulators”, he said.

The CGI scores are published annually and since 2019, Barita’s performance scores have shown significant improvement. The company’s CGI score of 59.40 in 2019, which is a CC rating, equivalent to the current average CGI rating for listed companies, has increased to 80.42 per cent, resulting in the company receiving a grade ‘A’ in the recent review.

“We are unrelenting in our pursuit of global best practice standards across our business. Notwithstanding our recent exemplary CGI score, we have a little more work to do to secure the highest possible scores in the different areas of the independent review, and so we will keep our heads down and continue to work towards further strengthening our governance infrastructure and practices”, Myers continued.  

Meanwhile, Deputy Chairman of Barita, Paul Simpson, commented: “Under the leadership and guidance of Michael Hylton, Barita’s newest Board Director and Chairman of the Board’s Governance Committee, together with Malindo Wallace, the company’s Group Legal Counsel and Company Secretary, the brokerage firm was able to effectively transform its governance structure and functions.”

Simpson pointed out that in addition to governance, risk management and compliance have been two critical areas that the boards of Barita and the Group have strengthened and transformed since the acquisition of the business by Cornerstone three years ago.

“We have established a comprehensive enterprise risk management framework that guides all key areas of our business operations to include strategic planning, on-book and off-book revenue-generating activities, operations management, internal controls, and inorganic related business expansion”, Simpson said.

Barita holds an industry-leading capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio of 52.4 per cent as at December 2021, which is well above the Financial Services Commission’s (FSC) minimum requirement of 10 per cent."
Barita,10/08/2021,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/barita-makes-us15000-donation-uhwis-covid-field-hospital-project,"Barita makes US$15,000 donation to UHWI's COVID field hospital project","Barita Investments Limited has donated US $15,000 to the University Hospital of the West Indies' special project which is intended to expand its facilities by between 60 to 80 additional beds for Covid-19 patients care. 

In a statement, Barita Investments noted that if made the donation to assist with the field hospital construction via the Private Sector Organisation of Jamaica (PSOJ) which is assisting in facilitating a multi-stakeholder private-sector initiative to assist the UHWI to expand its facilities.

Commenting on the project, Executive Director of Barita Foundation, Tanketa Chance-Wilson, noted that the donation is intended to fast-track emergency expansion efforts by the UHWI to add at least 19 modular hard-wall tent structures to its Accident and Emergency area, to help manage the spike in Covid-19 admissions.

Chance-Wilson said Barita Investments recognises that it's important to assist Jamaica in managing and overcoming what she described as arguably the greatest crisis which has faced the island and the globe, in general, in decades. 

Barita Investments Deputy Chairman, Paul Simpson, also commented on the contribution by the entity. 

Simpson said reports of discomfort being experienced by Jamaicans who contract COVID-19 are disturbing and the brokerage and investment firm is hopeful that its contribution will assist in easing the plight being faced by patients and healthcare workers who are operating in generally challenging circumstances.

Simpson also lauded healthcare workers in Jamaica for what he described as their stellar efforts in seeking to combat the pandemic.

He also commended other private sector stakeholders which have contributed to the UHWI field hospital/bed expansion initiative.

Simpson said he's confident that through a joint public/private sector effort, Jamaica will overcome current health and economic challenges which face the country.

The UHWI facility expansion project has seen a concrete base being built on the UHWI compound with an initial nineteen units.

The units have been equipped with the required equipment to facilitate, electricity, flow vents, with facilities for water supply and waste removal also included."
Barita,02/16/2021,https://jamaica.loopnews.com/content/barita-deploying-its-capital-extreme-caution,Barita deploying its capital with ‘extreme caution’,"Following a successful additional public offer (APO) in which it raised $13.5 billion in new capital, Barita Investments Limited is treading cautiously due to the market impact of increased liquidity.

Chairman Mark Myers, in comments attached to the company’s first-quarter results, ended December 31, 2020, said: “Having closed our landmark $13.5 billion additional public offer (APO) in Q4 of FY20, the group quickly pivoted to begin the process of deploying this capital efficiently during the first quarter of the 2021 financial year. 

“However, our performance must be interpreted within the context of the ongoing pandemic and the attendant monetary and fiscal policy initiatives.”

Myers said the policy response from central banks and governments has significantly increased liquidity in major financial markets, which, in conjunction with other factors, has buoyed risk-asset price levels. 

These said policy measures have, however, also potentially enabled a widening divergence between the state of underlying economic fundamentals and risk-assets prices, which has introduced an additional layer of risk for Barita’s managers, Myers noted.

Myers said against that background, “we have proceeded to deploy our capital with extreme caution and within the context of our robust risk management framework.”

He outlined that the company’s focus going forward is to continue growth initiatives aimed at expanding its capital market capabilities, broadening product offerings, and improving the ability to serve an expanding client base. 

“We will also continue to fortify our traditional business lines such as trading and asset management, being mindful of elevated risk levels resulting from the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Myers added.  

For the first quarter ended December 31, 2020, Barita reported net profits after taxation of $1.02 billion registering a 103 per cent rise relative to $503 million, for the comparable period in 2019.

Net operating revenue of $2 billion for the December quarter 2020 represented an $862 million (76 per cent) increase over the comparative quarter of 2019. 

Revenue during the review period included net interest income which recorded a $159 million (76 per cent) increase to $367 million compared to December quarter 2019. 

Non-interest income for the December quarter 2020 grew by 76 per cent or $703 million to $1.6 billion relative to $923 million reported for December quarter 2019. 

Non-interest income as a percentage of net operating revenues was 82 per cent during the period. 

Revenue also included a gain on investment activities, a business segment related to managing the company’s proprietary trading portfolio, which closed the period registering a 165 per cent or $417 million increase to $670 million. 

Fees and commission income declined by 20 per cent to $466 million relative to the corresponding December quarter 2019 result of $578 million. 

Barita registered foreign exchange trading and translation gains of $486 million in Q1, which compares favourably to $87 million recorded in December quarter 2019.
 
Operating expenses totalled $679 million for the three months ended December 2020, a 38 per cent increase over the comparative quarter of 2019.

This was due to increases in staff costs (38 per cent) and administrative expenses (32 per cent), while the group’s expected credit losses (ECL) rose to $73 million up from $40 million in December quarter 2019, Barita stated.

The increase in ECL is a function of the significant balance sheet expansion, in particular the increasing credit portfolio, it was outlined.  

The rise in expenses was linked to human capital management, customer acquisition initiatives, and upgrades to customer experience infrastructure. 

Notwithstanding the growth in operating expenses, the Barita’s efficiency ratio was 34 per cent versus 43 per cent for December quarter 2019. 
 
Directors outlined that Barita’s on-book assets of $69.9 billion as at December 2020, represents a $24.7 billion or 55 per cent increase over December quarter 2019. 

This increase is largely due to a $26 billion growth in investment assets throughout the period. 

To fund the increase in total assets, total liabilities rose by 33 per cent or $10.3 billion to $41.4 billion when compared with December quarter 2019. At $36.6 billion, repos represent the single largest liability and represent a 29 per cent increase relative to December quarter 2019.   

The equity base of the group rose by 102 per cent or $14.4 billion year-over-year to close the reporting period at $28.5 billion. 

Directors said that the growth in shareholders’ equity was largely a result of the injection of additional equity in the group, arising from the $13.5 billion APO; and an increase in retained earnings, net of dividends declared during the period. 

“As we deploy capital, we will do so in a prudent manner with a focus on achieving optimal risk-adjusted returns while protecting against downside risk,” the chairman noted. "
